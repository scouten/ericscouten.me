**Hi, I'm Eric.** It's great to have met you!

<!-- more -->

## tl;dr: Contact Info

The best ways to continue the conversation are via these sites:

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericscouten)
* [Mastodon](https://ericscouten.social/@scouten)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/eric.scouten)

Given that publicly-listed e-mail and phone are spam magnets these days (sigh), I rotate them every few months. The contacts listed below will work during IIW and for a while thereafter, but LinkedIn/Mastodon are probably a better bet in the long term:

* [es.iiw36@fastmail.com](mailto:es.iiw36@fastmail.com)
* [+1.360.764.4418](sms:+13607644418)

## Why I'm Here

I work for [Adobe](https://adobe.com), managing the services and infrastructure team for our Creative Credentials effort. This dovetails with several open-source and industry standards efforts that Adobe helps to lead, notably:

* **[Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)](https://contentauthenticity.org):** a cross-industry business coalition to help _content creators_ provide credible trust signals about their work and help educate _content consumers_ about those trust signals.
* **[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authencity (C2PA)](https://c2pa.org):** a [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/) project to collectively build an end-to-end open technical standard to provide publishers, creators, and consumers with opt-in, flexible ways to understand the authenticity and provenance of different types of media
* **[Open-source implementation of C2PA (c2pa-rs SDK)](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-rs/):** a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) implementation of the C2PA technical standards

I'm at IIW because we're interested in how identity intersects with our efforts to help content creators credibly distinguish their authentic content from misattributed content.

## Outside of Work

I live near Seattle, Washington, in the northwestern corner of the United States.

My dad first introduced me to computers in 1975 and [I haven't really stopped using them since](https://ericscouten.dev/about/).

I'm an adventurous traveler and explorer. I've visited and driven a car in every state of the US, every province of Canada, and [more than 40 other countries](https://ericscouten.travel/countries/) all over the world. I've visited another 20 or so countries where I didn't drive.

I take a lot of photos when I travel, but I think of myself more as a _digital storyteller_ than a photographer.

If I've captured your interest, you can find some of my travel stories at these sites:

* **[ericscouten.travel](https://ericscouten.com):** This is my primary travel blog, in which I publish stories from travels all over the world. Most recently, I've [spent a month exploring the Southeastern US](https://ericscouten.travel/2023/03-18+southeastern-us/) with my partner.
* **[146 Parks](https://146parks.blog):** My home state of Washington has 146 state parks. In the depths of the pandemic, when bigger travel plans were off the table, I decided to visit and document every one of them. I've posted 116 park visits so far.
