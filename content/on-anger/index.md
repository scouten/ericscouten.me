This post is an invitation to you to contemplate some topics I've been thinking about recently.

<!-- more -->

**Question 1:** When you encounter anger in your proximity, are you a **force multiplier** for it? _(Wikipedia defines [force multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication) as "a factor or a combination of factors that gives personnel or weapons ... the ability to accomplish greater feats than without it." That definition works well for me.)_

In other words, do you amplify anger when you encounter it? Or do you work to dissipate it?

Same for anxiety.

Same for fear.

I ask this question without regard to topic and especially without regard to whether you align with me on the weighty political or religious topics of the day.

**Question 2:** Having answered that question, how do you feel about your answer?

...

You might have noticed that I've been conspicuously quiet on many topics recently. It's because I'm contemplating these questions.

My answers:

* Yes, historically, I've been a force multiplier for anger, anxiety, and fear.
* No, I'm not at all comfortable with where that's led me or how that's influenced those around me.

## Now What?

I now think that if you can't respectfully understand the point of view of the person you are conversing with, you have essentially no chance of persuading them of anything.

_Very few people change their minds when backed into a corner and told how wrong they are._

Which means I'll probably continue to be quiet on the issues of the day. Not because I don't have opinions, but because I want to think through how to participate in a way that doesn't add fuel to the already scorching fires of today's public discourse.

Meanwhile, some articles and podcasts that I've found influential recently:

* [Adam Grant on LinkedIn: How to think about disagreements](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7376607228428046337/)
* [Donald Roberston's podcast](https://overcast.fm/+AA92rkAFC94). I've linked to one episode, but several episodes in 2025 cover the topic of anger. A couple of favorite quotes, which may or may not be in _this_ episode:
  * "Angry people specialize in making things worse."
  * "If you're angry you may as well be drunk. You have a similar lack of impulse control."
  * "What causes you more harm: Your anger or the thing that you're angry about?"

...

I'd love to hear what thoughts this inspires.

**Important:** This is _not_ an invitation to spout off on today's political or social topics. It's only an invitation to talk about _how_ we talk about those issues.
